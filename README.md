#### History of _FrogCraft_
FrogCraft is an add-on Mod (i.e. add-on, plugin, modification on Minecraft) for IndustrialCraft2, majorly about chemical industry, authored by Rikka. Rikka originally posted it [here][link_origin], then he stopped at 1.6.2; M3gaFra3k ported it to 1.6.4 and posted [here][link_164port].  
Although the author said that he won't continue on FrogCraft due to the fact that GregTech now has implemented lots of his ideas, I still decided to carry this torch, because I remember how much happiness it has brought to me, and also many players I probably don't know.  
What you see right now is FrogCraft: Rebirth (under `1710port` branch), *not FrogCraft 2* (for more info please see below). However, part of these codes are prepared for the FrogCraft 2.  

FrogCraft will insist on being an IC2 addon. 
Regarding to 1.8/1.9: depends. EU is dropped but the key is that a mod shall have *soul*.

#### About _FrogCraft 2: Chemica_
FrogCraft 2: *Chemica* (latin. chemistry) is a mod highly concentrating on chemical industry, aiming to establish a whole system about chemicals synthetic and usage. 

FrogCraft 2: *Chemica* will try to follow [Cult of Kitteh](http://asie.pl/kitteh/). 

Yes, NO GUI. It sounds as if I am insane, but I have my own idea. 
Thanks to asie, otherwise I won't even think about such a design.
