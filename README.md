#### Introduction
FrogCraft: Rebirth is spiritual successor of FrogCraft, an addon Mod for IndustrialCraft2/GregTech, majorly about chemical industry, featured with following:
 * Advanced Chemical Reactor
 * Pyrolyzer
 * Fast production line of Liquid Air
 * Massive EU storage unit with limited functionality
 * Combustion Furnace - regular generator but also can collect byproduct
 * Mobile Power Station
 * New ores
 * Decay Battery (Creative Only for now)
 * Ammonia Coolant
 * Eastern Eggs and more!

**This mod requires Java 8 to run**.  
Due to GregTech is still in 1.7.10, compability for GregTech is disabled for now.  
If you wonder where are Railgun and Academy Windmill, I suggest you to take a look at [AcademyCraft][link_ACMOD]. 

#### Future plan: _FrogCraft 2: Chemia_
*FrogCraft 2: Chemia* (aka Laboratorium Chemiae) is a mod highly concentrating on chemical industry, aiming to establish a whole system about chemicals synthetic and usage. 

*FrogCraft 2: Chemia* will follow [Cult of Kitteh][link_CultOfKitteh].  
Yes, NO GUI. It sounds like insane, but it *will* be.
