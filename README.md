# FrogCraft: Rebirth
Everything is about chemistry. Don't abuse it, or the environment will be destoryed.  
Also, don't pay much attention on this project. *I will do it by myself, no matter how hard it is for me.*

### About _FrogCraft: Rebirth_
FrogCraft is an add-on Mod (i.e. add-on, plugin, modification on Minecraft) for IndustrialCraft2, majorly about chemical industry, authored by Rikka. Rikka originally posted it [here][link_origin], then he stopped at 1.6.2; M3gaFra3k ported it to 1.6.4 and posted [here][link_164port].  
Although the author said that he won't continue on FrogCraft, I still want to carry the torch, because I remember how much happiness it has brought to me, and also many players I probably don't know.  
What you see right now is FrogCraft: Rebirth (under `1710port` branch), *not FrogCraft 2* (for more info please see below). However, some api code are prepared for the FrogCraft 2.  

### About _FrogCraft 2: Chemica_
FrogCraft 2: *Chemica* (latin. chemistry) is a mod concentrating on chemical industry, aiming to establish a whole system about syntheticing chemicals and making a good use.
FrogCraft 2: *Chemica* will follow [Cult of Kitteh](http://asie.pl/kitteh/). 
Thanks to asie, otherwise I won't even think about such a design.

### About _TriTChemLab_
What? What is it? I have no idea yet!  
Basically it is an API library, any implementation of this API should provide a system to read, express and use all kinds of data, e.g.: elements and their properties, chemical equation and rough predition, simple calculation.

### License
Currently the license *is* still unknown, but it is more likely to be MIT or BSD (unsure version).  
At least I got touch on original author (Rikka) and he permited the right to use original codes.
