# FrogCraft: Rebirth

Loading...

Beside, new FrogCraft (i.e. FrogCraft 2) will follow [Cult of Kitteh](http://asie.pl/kitteh/)  
What you see right now is FrogCraft: Rebirth (under `1710port` branch), *not FrogCraft 2*. However, some api code are prepared for the FrogCraft 2.
Currently the license *is* still unknown, but it is more likely to be MIT or BSD (unsure ver.).
