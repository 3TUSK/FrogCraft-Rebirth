### Introduction
FrogCraft: Rebirth is spiritual successor of [FrogCraft][link_FrogCraft_original] (and also the [ported one][link_FrogCraft_ported]), an addon Mod for IndustrialCraft2/GregTech, majorly about chemical industry, featured with following:
 * Advanced Chemical Reactor
 * Pyrolyzer
 * Fast production line of Liquid Air
 * Massive EU storage unit with limited functionality
 * Combustion Furnace - regular generator but also can collect byproduct
 * Mobile Power Station
 * New ores
 * Decay Battery (Creative Only for now)
 * Ammonia Coolant
 * Eastern Eggs and more!
 
### What's changed in this version?
 * Due to GregTech is still in 1.7.10, compatibilities for GregTech, including Pnuematic Compressor, are disabled for now. 
 * Thermal Cracker is renamed to Pyrolyzer.
 * Cells are removed. Use IC2 Universal Fluid Cell instead.
 * Railgun and Academy Windmill are removed. The reason of FrogCraft being named so is believed as a reference to anime [_A Certain Scientific Railgun_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Certain_Scientific_Railgun), and the evidences are the Railgun and Academy Windmill. Right now I consider [AcademyCraft][link_ACMOD] as the spiritual successor of FrogCraft's anime elements.
 * As a replacement, a whole new item named *Portable Ion Cannon* is added. This is a rough reference to [Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_%26_Conquer_3:_Tiberium_Wars) plots.
 * Marble and Basalt are removed. They used to be a substitution to RedPower's Marble and Basalt, but now I suggest to use other equivalents, e.g. Chisel.
 * Ruby, Sapphire and Green Sapphire are substituted with [Tiberium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberium). Reason is same as Marble and Basalt.
 * **This mod now requires Java 8 to run**. If you plan to use FrogCraft: Rebirth on dedicated server, please be aware of your Java version.

### Future plan: _FrogCraft 2: Chemia_
*FrogCraft 2: Chemia* (aka Laboratorium Chemiae) is a mod highly concentrating on chemical industry, aiming to establish a whole system about chemicals synthetic and usage. 

*FrogCraft 2: Chemia* will follow [Cult of Kitteh][link_CultOfKitteh].  
Yes, NO GUI. It sounds like insane, but it *will* be.
