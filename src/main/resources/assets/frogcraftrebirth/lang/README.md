# Welcome to localization project of FrogCraft
Here you can found the localization files used by FrogCraft. You can also find some useful guideline here. 
Officially I keep maintaining two files, which are `zh_CN.lang` and `en_US.lang`.  
If you are willing to help to translate FrogCraft into your language, I will appreciate it. 

Since I am also a Minecraft Mod translator, I clearly know that it is not possible for most translators to update the translation to lasted version before next release. Thus, I will leave one or more to wait for translation.

# Submitting new translation / Contributing on existed translation
If you would like to submitting a new translation, or contributing on existed translation, you may choose to _fork_ this repository and add/edit files, and then open a pull request here. I do not accept the language file manually (i.e. sending file(s) via issue or something else).  
Also, I will say thanks if you can keep commit number into one, or squash your commits into one.  
It _doesn't_ means you have to do so, but means it will be better to do so.

# What if I find something weird and I cannot find a proper translation?
* It's true that there is some special slang usage. If you're not sure about the exact meaning please do not hesitate to open an new issue [here](https://github.com/FrogCraft-Rebirth/FrogCraft-Rebirth/issue) and I will answer you as soon as possible.  
* Also it is possible that you find a typo. You can either correct it by yourself or open an issue to remind me. Or just send pull request, which may be a bit faster.
